Hi, everyone,

<p>

Mark and I hope that you have been able to stay safely distanced and healthy
this year, and wish you the best for the coming year.  

<p>

As was also true for everyone, the year 2020 was not at all what we had
planned or hoped.  We were both on sabbatical in the spring semester, with plans
to travel to Australia, Europe, and around the US - for work and for play -
that were canceled.  But also over the course of the year we grew much closer with 
our families in this new era in which it's just as easy to visit a sibling 
in another state as a friend across the street over Zoom.


<p>


My mother passed away in February.  
Mark and I, my brothers and sisters-in-law,
my first cousin Carol and her family,
several of Mom's college friends, my best friend
from high school Christine, my high school English teacher,
and other friends of the family all came together for
the visitation and funeral, which was wonderful support.
My mother was an artist all
of her life, creating her own crafts and in particular 
banners with motivational messages (or logos of sports teams!).
She also created 
artwork with needlepoint, drawing, and plastics.

In the fall semester Mark and I both 
decided to do all of our work remotely.
Teaching online (over Zoom) for the first time required a lot
of extra work to create new materials, use new technology, 
keep the students engaged, etc.  The learning curve was quite steep
and kept us hopping.
Mark and I also gave talks in our first online research
conference in September, giving us the opportunity to
catch up with several
research colleagues we haven't seen for quite a few years.
One of the silver linings of this pandemic year is that talks in 
research conferences and seminars worldwide are now available to
us at home; in some ways that has made keeping up with
what is happening in our research areas easier than usual this year,
and I hope that many online seminars and conferences will continue
to run after we can safely return to traveling.




<p>

In this year of not traveling, 
our photograph collection involves a lot of
nature ...	

<p>

... in our back yard, including three baby birds -
robin, Carolina wren, and cardinal - and a fox! ...

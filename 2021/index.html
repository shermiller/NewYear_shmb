Hi, everyone,

<p>

Mark and I hope that you have been well and enjoyed 2021, 
and we wish you the best for the coming year.  

<p>

This year has been busy with work, but we have continued to work
from home, including teaching, working with our advisees, and going
to meetings. We both participated in (many) more conferences than
usual this year, taking advantage of the much greater access to
talks with conferences being available online. 
Three of Mark's doctoral advisees (Jesse, Robert, and Vincent) finished
their degrees and moved to new jobs this year, making a substantial
change for Mark, too. I also had a sizable change at work;
my last year as Graduate Chair ended in August, after 10 years (minus 2 sabbatical years).
I miss some parts of that work,
but it has also been interesting to concentrate more on other aspects of my job.

<p>

Our dining room table was converted into my work desk
in 2020, and I frequently have interesting visitors outside on the
deck a few feet from my chair.  
A family of foxes - including a 
very adorable kit (the fox with the white tail tip)
who loved to play and roughhouse - spent a lot of time in
our backyard and occasionally on the deck. Our (heated) bird baths
are very popular in the winter time, too.  Each day the sparrows apparently
agree on a common bath time, and then try to find out how many sparrows 
can squeeze into a bird bath simultaneously. After that, they fling water 
around with abandon, emptying the bird baths quite quickly.

Although we did not travel this year because of the
pandemic, we visited some local parks
more frequently this year. I decided to use the opportunity
to enjoy - and learn the names of - many of the local wildflowers, 
and Mark took wonderful photos of many of them.
Butterflies, moths, and bees frequently took part in the
photos, too!  At one particular park
about 10 miles south of our home we returned quite often, 
watching the flowers in the fields
and roadsides changing through the seasons, and  
the beauty we saw while walking the gravel roads
in and near the park was astounding.
Here is a selection of a few favorites from the year:

For those of you who may be curious about what is in
these nature photos:
In the first row
left-to-right are a prairie wild rose, partridge pea, and
whorled milkweed with a monarch butterfly.
The second row has a trumpet creeper,
a purple coneflower with a pearl crescent butterfly,
and a tall goldenrod with a viceroy.
In the last row are 
hoary vervain with a silver-spotted skipper,
daisy fleabane and field bindweed,
and blue sage with a white-lined sphinx moth. 
The sphinx moth was particularly surprising to us: it is a moth, but it flies
and drinks nectar from flowers remarkably like a hummingbird.

In April a very neat part of the spring bird migration happened
right over our front yard: A flock of cedar waxwings spent several
days eating flowers from our neighbor's tree that overhangs our driveway. 
We wondered very much what our 
neighbors thought of our watching and photographing the tree for
so long each day, but we also wondered at them for not looking
up in the tree themselves and watching the show!
In November we went to Loess Bluffs NWR to see more of the
migration; in the picture below/right are 
trumpeter swans, white-fronted geese, and mallards.

We continue to miss friends and family especially while not traveling
because of the pandemic, but we've 
appreciated being able to keep in contact through Zoom, email, etc.
Happy holidays and new year to all of you! 
Mark and I wish you the best for 2022.

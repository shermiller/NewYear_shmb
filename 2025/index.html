Hi, everyone,
</p> 

<p>
Mark and I hope that all is well with you, and we wish you the best for 2026.

This year we visited both Mark's family and mine more often than usual, and appreciated our time with them very much. 
In May Mark's mother passed away, at the age of 97. She was inspirational in so many ways, and we miss our daily phone calls with her. We traveled to NY state three times over the summer, spending several weeks there for the funeral, Mark's niece's wedding, and to help with sorting out the contents of his parents' house. At the same time we were able to connect with Mark's siblings, siblings-in-law, nieces, nephews, and nephews-in-law, and their kids, much more, which was wonderful. 
We also traveled to Indiana to visit with my brothers and sisters-in-law several times, and enjoyed watching the birds at my brother's feeder as well as a green heron who posed for us in a neighborhood pond.

Our work lives took a rather unexpected turn this summer. In June we found that some large-scale computations we'd been working on for many years (roughly a decade) in the field of knot theory resulted in a surprising outcome, showing that an 88-year-old conjecture is not true. Even more surprising to us, after we posted a preprint about the result on the web, we started getting emails from reporters asking for interviews! In case you're curious, there is a nice article in Wired Magazine at 
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/unpicking-how-to-measure-the-complexity-of-knots/">
https://www.wired.com/story/unpicking-how-to-measure-the-complexity-of-knots/</a>
and a you-tube video explaining the result (and proving it with rope!) by a well-known math expositor at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx7f-nGohVc">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx7f-nGohVc</a>.
It has been a neat experience, although at
times a bit overwhelming; the best part of all has been
renewing contact with many mathematical friends
who wrote to us after they saw the news, and getting
to catch up with them.
</p>

<p>
Another nice piece of news for the year is
that my health has improved. After
having trouble with atrial fibrillation for the
past few years, I had an ablation procedure in February;
after months of increased irregular beats, things
have calmed, and I have now had more than 10 months
with no (or no long) fibrillation. I very much appreciate 
how much less worrisome it is to 
drive, travel, etc. 
</p>

We continue to find opportunities to enjoy nature and record it in pictures.
In August we traveled to Yellowstone National Park and spent several days seeing more of the geothermal features there than ever before. Here are a few of our favorites, namely Daisy geyser, Morning Glory Pool, Cliff geyser (with little Spouter geyser also erupting in the background), 
Artists' Paint Pots, Yellowstone canyon (with 
its sides of yellow stone), and Fountain Paint Pots:

Along the way we saw a (super-cute!) pair of
baby ruby-crowned kinglets and an osprey.
We also spent a couple of days in Grand Teton National Park,
where we saw the well-camouflaged dusky grouse below.
We ended the week with a great day of birding
at Antelope Island State Park in Utah with our friend Melanie;
pictured here are a
black-necked stilt and a group of red-necked phalaropes
surrounded by masses of brine flies.

While on the east coast this summer we took
a few days to visit the Blue Ridge Parkway, and
several places in NJ and NY states.
The wildflowers were awesome!!

The top row are flame azalea, fire pink, and Catawba
rhododendron along the Blue Ridge.
The middle row has harlequin blue flag, American water lily,
and yellow flag from Sapsucker Woods
in Ithaca. 
And on the bottom are purple sneezeweed from the
Great Swamp (NJ), and American water-willow 
and cardinal flower in Princeton. 
</p>


<p>
Here in Nebraska spring migration brought 
80 American white pelicans to a reservoir about 10 miles 
from our home. We also made our annual daytrip to
see the sandhill cranes, and watched them gathering
on the Platte River at sunset.
